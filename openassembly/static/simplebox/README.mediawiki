== SimpleBox ==

SimpleBox is extremely light and provides you with a nice little dialog for your confirmation messages, simple image previews and just about anything where a full LightBox is just overkill.

Using SimpleBox is extremely simple, include the JS file, one image, and a couple of lines of CSS and you are good to go.

To make SimpleBox more accessible, SimpleBox binds to the 'c' access key as welll as the escape key to close a SimpleBox.

=== Usage ===

To open the dialog: $("#containerid").simplebox();

To close the dialog: $("#containerid").simplebox('close');
